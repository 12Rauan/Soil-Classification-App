# Soil Classification App

This project is a machine learning-based web application for soil type classification using images. It utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet50 model to classify soil into four categories: **Black Soil**, **Cinder Soil**, **Laterite Soil**, and **Yellow Soil**.

## Introduction
Soil classification plays a crucial role in agricultural planning and soil analysis. This app simplifies the process by using a deep learning model to classify soil images with high accuracy. Users can upload soil images and receive real-time predictions.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - A dataset of soil images was divided into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Data augmentation (e.g., rotation, flipping, resizing) was applied to improve model generalization.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The ResNet50 model was fine-tuned:
     - The last 20 layers of ResNet were unfrozen for retraining.
     - Fully connected layers were modified to predict 4 soil classes.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The model was optimized using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
   - Validation and test datasets were used to measure performance.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The model is integrated with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface, allowing predictions via a simple web application.
