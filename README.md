# Soil Classification App

This project is a machine learning-based web application for soil type classification using images. It utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet50 model to classify soil into four categories: Black Soil, Cinder Soil, Laterite Soil, and Yellow Soil.

## **Introduction**
The app simplifies soil classification for agricultural planning and soil analysis. Users can upload an image of soil, and the app will predict its type with high accuracy.

## **Methodology**
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - A dataset of soil images was split into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and resizing were applied to improve model robustness.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A pretrained ResNet50 was fine-tuned:
     - The last 20 layers were unfrozen to allow retraining.
     - Fully connected layers were modified to output predictions for four classes.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
   - Achieved high accuracy on validation and test sets.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to classify soil images via a web interface.

## **Features**
- Upload soil images to classify into four types.
- Provides real-time predictions using a fine-tuned neural network.
- Lightweight and easy to deploy locally or on a cloud platform.
